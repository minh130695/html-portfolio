        <h3>Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol</h3>
        <p>The best action movies. I love how Tom Cruise climbed outside of the Burj Khalifa building</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Transformer 1</h3>
        <p>The best CGI movie in the world. By 2007, seeing machines transforming into a robot is fascinating.</p>
